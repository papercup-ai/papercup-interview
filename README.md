# Papercup Interview Tests 

Congratulations to making it to our final round. Thank you for taking the time to do our technical test. Out tests
are designed to test range of skills, starting from the front-end (React + Typescript), backend (Python or Go), and
database skills. 

This repo is provided prior the final round, but the actual coding will be done in person. Please review the material prior,
relevant links and notes are provided below and in the readme of the tasks.

It is preferable that you bring your own laptop, if you are unable to do so please inform the person 
responsible for organising the final stage of the interview. You can set up your environment on your machine as you like,
and will be allowed to access any online resource to help you complete the exercise. Someone from the team will be available
through out the process to help you in case if you have any questions.

Tasks:
- [Build a webapp, and style it](/drinks_vehicles)
- [Create an orders database and query it](/cups_database)
